      Here at the Krazy Koala HQ, we know what it's like to have an unruly pet
      koala. We've seen the horror stories first hand. Eucalyptus leaves
      everywhere, little koala droppings in places they ought not to be. That's
      why we created Krazy Koala, Koala Training! In just a week your little
      companion can have the koalafications to be your personal service animal!
      Sit, stay, cook, clean, you name it they can do it!
